# Developer Diagnostics

The markdown files in this directory are generated by the stress and sequence parity harnesses under `crapssim_api/tests/`. They capture detailed roll-by-roll comparisons between the HTTP adapter and the vanilla engine.

These reports are useful when verifying parity or extending the API surface. They are **not** required for day-to-day API usage and can be regenerated locally by running the stress harnesses in the test suite.
