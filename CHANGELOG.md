## [Unreleased]

### Added

* New bets: `Horn`, `World` (Whirl), `Big6`/`Big8`, `Buy`, `Lay`, and `Put` (with or without odds) 
  * Corresponding single bet strategies
  * Corresponding odds strategies: `PutOddsAmount`, `PutOddsMultiplier`
  * Corresponding examples strategies: `QuickProps`, `BuySampler`, `LaySampler`, `PutWithOdds`, `HornExample`, `WorldExample`
* Vig policy settings to TableSettings
* `WinMultiplier` family of strategies which take a desired win multiple and calculates the correct amount based on the bet amount. 
  * `WinMultiplier` is the general strategy which takes specific bet type argument
  * Convenience strategies for individual bets: `PassLineWinMultiplier`, `ComeWinMultiplier`, `DontPassWinMultiplier`, `DontComeWinMultiplier`, and `PutWinMultiplier` 
* Stress tests, expanded examples, tools as part of the Vanilla Expansion Project

### Fixed

*  `DontPass` and `DontCome` bets will now "push" on a come-out 12, bringing the bet down and returing the bet amount to the player. `_WinningLosingNumbersBet` gains `get_push_numbers()` method to accomodate. 
*  `OddsMultiplier `__repr__` logic so that floats, ints, and incomplete dictionaries all work for odds/win multiplier

## [0.3.1] - 2025-02-13

### What's Changed
* **BREAKING**: Rename strategy tools and implement new strategy modes by @skent259 in https://github.com/skent259/crapssim/pull/55
  * Renamed many strategy tools. In addition, breaking change in functionality of BetPlace, and any strategy that uses BetPlace (including PlaceInside, IronCross, Hammerlock, Risk12, Place68DontCome2Odds). To keep old behavior, you need to update to BetPlace(..., strategy_mode=StrategyMode.ADD_IF_POINT_ON) for the corresponding strategy. This will have place bets working during come-out rolls.
