A python package to run all of the necessary elements of a Craps table.  The package follows some natural logic: 

- a `CrapsTable` has `Player`(s) and `Dice` on it
- the `Player`(s) have `Bet`(s) on the `CrapsTable` as prescribed by their strategies.  

With these building blocks, crapssim supports 

- running **1 session** with **1 player/strategy** to test a realistic day at the craps table,
- running **many sessions** with **1 player/strategy** to understand how a strategy performs in the long term, or
- running **many sessions** with **many players/strategies** to simulate how they compare to each other

These powerful options can lead to some unique analysis of the game of craps, such as the following figure comparing 4 strategies with a budget of $200:

## Installation

For a normal user, it is recommended to install the official release. You will 
need an installation of python version 3.10 or newer.  Then, run the following 
code in your terminal: 

```python
pip install crapssim
```

## Getting Started

There's a few good resources for getting started:

1. Try the interactive [google collab notebook](https://github.com/skent259/crapssim/blob/master/crapssim_sandbox.ipynb) to test a single strategy and see how the interface works 
2. Check out Corey Brown's scripts to define strategies and compare them: https://github.com/coreyabrown/CoreyCrapsSim 
3. Looks at the minimal working examples below


To see how a single session might play out for you using a pass line bet with double odds, over 20 rolls, one might run:

```python
import crapssim as craps

table = craps.Table()
your_strat = craps.strategy.passline_odds2

table.add_player(bankroll=100, strategy=your_strat)
table.run(max_rolls=20)
```

To evaluate a couple of strategies across many table sessions, you can run:

```python
import crapssim as craps

n_sim = 20
bankroll = 300
strategies = {
    "place68": craps.strategy.place68,
    "ironcross": craps.strategy.ironcross
}

for i in range(n_sim):
    table = craps.Table()
    for s in strategies:
        table.add_player(bankroll=100, strategy=s)

    table.run(max_rolls=float("inf"), max_shooter=10, verbose=False)
    for p in table.players:
        print(f"{i}, {p.strategy}, {p.bankroll}, {bankroll}, {table.dice.n_rolls}")
```

For more advanced strategies, you need to write a custom function that can perform the strategy.  Some building blocks and examples can be found in [strategy.py](./crapssim/strategy.py)

Those looking to contribute to this project are welcome to do so.  Currently, the top priority is to improve

- Supported bets (see [bet.py](./crapssim/bet.py))
- Supported strategies (see [strategy.py](./crapssim/strategy.py))
- Documentation
