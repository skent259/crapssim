    "# Tutorial 1: Starting off with strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "In the crapssim package, a strategy is just a set of rules to describe exactly how a player will bet under any table situation. Put another way, the strategies are the primary way that a `Player` object (with their bankroll and bets) interacts with the `Table` object (with the dice, point, and other table features). We can simulate how one or many sessions would play out with the selected strategy, to understand if it fits out playing style, objectives, and compares favorably to other strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first tutorial, the goal is to show how to use the pre-built strategies to easily simulate some realistic casino scenarios. The next tutorials will build on this by showing how to combine strategies, use available tools to define simple logical strategies, and finally how to write your own custom strategy that can handle any situation you can dream up.

In this example, we create a `Table` that will keep track of the dice rolling, turning point on/off, and other measurements. Then we add a player to the table with the `BetPassLine` strategy, with a \\$10 bet. Then we run the table for 20 rolls to see how the bet will play out."

    "Strategy modes are an easy way to control when these single bets will be placed. For example, it makes sense to `BetPassLine()` when the point is off (`ADD_IF_POINT_OFF`), because otherwise we would be better off to place the point number. However, with the `BetYo()`, which wins on an 11, some players would only play this when the point is off while others might play more frequently. The full list of strategy modes is given below, and most are self-explanatory:\n",
    "\n",
    "`StrategyMode`:\n",
    "- `ADD_IF_NON_EXISTENT`: Adds a bet if the current player doesn't already have it. This is essentially the same as playing the bet always.\n",
    "- `ADD_IF_POINT_OFF`: Adds a bet only if the point is off\n",
    "- `ADD_IF_POINT_ON`: Adds a bet only if the point is on\n",
    "- `ADD_IF_NEW_SHOOTER`: Adds a bet only if there is a new shooter (i.e. the previous player has just seven-ed out)\n",
    "- `ADD_OR_INCREASE`: After each roll of the dice, the bet will be added (if it doesn't exist) or the bet amount will be increased by one unit (if it already exists)\n",
    "- `BET_IF_POINT_ON`: Player bets only if the point is on (i.e. also removes the bets when point is off, in contrast to `ADD_IF_POINT_ON`). Useful for place bets which typically are not working when the point is off. \n",
    "- `REPLACE`: Will remove all bets of this type (when possible) before adding a new one. This mode is less useful, so don't worry if it's confusing now\n",

    "In this tutorial, we've seen how to use the out-of-the-box strategies from the crapssim package, including `single_bet` and more detailed `examples`. We've seen how to look at the strategies on a small number of rolls, which is great for testing or getting a feel for the strategy. We've also seen how to compare multiple strategies across several sessions, which creates the basis for determining which we might want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to get more comfortable with this is to try it out for yourself! See if you can install the package and test these available strategies.\n",

    "Quickly, you may find that you want to put together more detailed strategies of your own. The next tutorial will show you how to use these building blocks to make more complicated strategies, and to incorporate some core logic if needed. "
