   Bases: :py:obj:`crapssim.strategy.tools.AggregateStrategy`


   Bet the PassLine and Place the 6 and the 8. Equivalent to: BetPassLine(pass_line_amount) +

   Bases: :py:obj:`crapssim.strategy.tools.Strategy`


   Strategy that makes place bets on the six and eight, and then if a PassLine or Come bet with
   that point comes up, moves the place bet to 5 or 9.


   .. py:attribute:: pass_come_amount


   .. py:attribute:: six_eight_amount


   .. py:attribute:: five_nine_amount


   .. py:method:: completed(player: crapssim.strategy.tools.Player) -> bool
