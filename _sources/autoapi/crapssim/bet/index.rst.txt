.. py:class:: BetResult

   Represents the outcome of a bet

   This class is used by all Bets for consistency in determining whether the
   bet won, lost or pushed. It provides properties to analyze the bet outcome
   and its impact on a bankroll.


   .. py:attribute:: amount
      :type:  float

      The monetary value representing the bet outcome.


   .. py:attribute:: remove
      :type:  bool

      Flag indicating whether this bet result should be removed from table.


   .. py:attribute:: bet_amount
      :type:  float
      :value: 0


      The monetary value of the original bet size. Needed only for bets that
      push and return the wager to the player. Default is zero for quick
      results that can define wins and losses by comparing against zero.


   .. py:property:: won
      :type: bool


      Returns True if the bet won (amount more than initial bet).


   .. py:property:: lost
      :type: bool


      Returns True if the bet lost (negative amount).


   .. py:property:: pushed
      :type: bool


      Returns True if the bet tied (zero amount).


   .. py:property:: bankroll_change
      :type: float


      Calculates the change to the bankroll (amount if bet won, zero otherwise).


.. py:class:: Bet(amount: SupportsFloat)

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`


   A generic bet for the craps table.

   The high-level class that defines most of the core bet methods.
   All bets will be a subclass of this.


   .. py:attribute:: amount
      :type:  float

      Wagered amount for the bet.


   .. py:method:: get_result(table: Table) -> BetResult
      :abstractmethod:


      Core bet logic that determines the result.

      This determines the ultimate amount and whether the
      bet needs to be removed, which is indicated with a
      BetResult object.



   .. py:method:: cost(table: Table) -> float

      Total bankroll required to put this bet in action on ``table``.



   .. py:method:: update_number(table: Table)

      Update the bet's number, if applicable

      This method is required by Come and DontCome bets to
      update their number after the first roll. Since this
      method is used by the Table, it defaults to doing nothing
      for a generic bet.



   .. py:method:: is_removable(table: Table) -> bool

      Checks whether the bet is removable. May depend on the
      table conditions (e.g. if point is On).

      :returns: True if the bet is removable, otherwise false.



   .. py:method:: is_allowed(player: Player) -> bool

      Checks whether the bet is allowed to be placed on the given table.
      May depend on the player's bets also (e.g. for odds bets).

      :returns: True if the bet is allowed, otherwise false.



   .. py:method:: copy() -> Bet

      Create a fresh copy of this bet



   .. py:property:: _placed_key
      :type: Hashable



   .. py:property:: _hash_key
      :type: Hashable



   .. py:method:: __eq__(other: object) -> bool


   .. py:method:: __hash__() -> int

   .. py:method:: __rsub__(other)


.. py:class:: _WinningLosingNumbersBet(amount: SupportsFloat)

   These values (possibly depending on the table) are used to
   calculate the result.


   .. py:method:: get_result(table: Table) -> BetResult

      Core bet logic that determines the result.

      Wins are based on having dice total in the winning numbers
      (which may depend on the table), which will pay the payout_ratio
      times the bet amount plus the original bet amount back. Losses
      happen when dice total is in the losing numbers, which result
      in a loss of the original bet amount. Otherwise the bet stays
      on the table.



   .. py:method:: get_winning_numbers(table: Table) -> list[int]
      :abstractmethod:

   Pass Line bet in craps.

   A bet where the player wins if the first roll is 7 or 11,
   loses if the first roll is 2, 3, or 12, and establishes a point number
   for subsequent rolls. Once a point is set, the player wins by rolling
   the point number again before rolling a 7. Pays 1 to 1.


   .. py:method:: get_winning_numbers(table: Table) -> list[int]

      Winnings numbers are 7, 11 before point is set,
      and the point number after point is set. Uses table
      to determine the point number and status.



   .. py:method:: get_losing_numbers(table: Table) -> list[int]

      Losing numbers are 2, 3, 12 before point is set,
      and 7 after point is set. Uses table to determine the
      point number and status.



   .. py:method:: get_payout_ratio(table: Table) -> float

      PassLine always pays out 1:1



   .. py:method:: is_removable(table: Table) -> bool

   Bases: :py:obj:`_WinningLosingNumbersBet`


   Come bet in craps.

   Similar to the Pass Line bet, but can be placed after a point is established.
   The first roll determines the Come bet's point number, but also wins on 7, 11
   and loses on 2, 3, 12. The bet wins in subsequent rolls if the
   point number is rolled before a 7, and loses if a 7 is rolled before
   the point number. Pays 1 to 1.


   .. py:method:: get_winning_numbers(table: Table) -> list[int]

      Winnings numbers are 7, 11 before the number is set,
      and the number after it is set. Number is stored within
      the bet.



   .. py:method:: get_losing_numbers(table: Table) -> list[int]

      Losing numbers are 2, 3, 12 before the number is set,
      and 7 after it is set. Number is stored within
      the bet.



   .. py:method:: get_payout_ratio(table: Table) -> float

      Come always pays out 1:1



   .. py:method:: update_number(table: Table)

      Update the bet's number to the first number rolled if it's in (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10).



   .. py:method:: is_removable(table: Table) -> bool

      Come bet is removable is it's number has not been established yet (first roll).

      :returns: True if the bet is removable, otherwise false.



   .. py:method:: is_allowed(player: Player) -> bool

      Create a fresh copy of this bet with no number



   .. py:property:: _placed_key
      :type: Hashable



   .. py:method:: __repr__() -> str


.. py:class:: DontPass(amount: SupportsFloat)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_WinningLosingNumbersBet`


   Don't Pass bet in craps.

   The opposite of the Pass Line bet. The player wins if the first roll is 2 or 3,
   pushes on 12, and loses if the first roll is 7 or 11. After a point is
   established, the player wins by rolling a 7 before the point number. Bet pays 1 to 1.


   .. py:method:: get_winning_numbers(table: Table) -> list[int]

      Winnings numbers are 2 or 3 before point is set,
      and 7 after point is set. Uses table to determine the point
      number and status.



   .. py:method:: get_losing_numbers(table: Table) -> list[int]

.. py:class:: DontCome(amount: SupportsFloat, number: int | None = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`_WinningLosingNumbersBet`


   Don't Come bet in craps.

   Similar to the Don't Pass bet, but can be placed after a point is
   established, but also wins on 2, 3, pushes on 12, and loses on 7 or 11.
   The first roll determines the Don't Come bet's number. The bet wins in
   subsequent rolls if a 7 is rolled before the point number, and loses if
   the number is rolled before a 7. Pays 1 to 1.

      Update the bet's number, if applicable

      This method is required by Come and DontCome bets to
      update their number after the first roll. Since this
      method is used by the Table, it defaults to doing nothing
      for a generic bet.



   .. py:method:: is_allowed(player: Player) -> bool

   Odds bet (for PassLine, DontPass, Come, or Dontcome) in craps.

   A supplementary bet placed behind Pass Line, Don't Pass, Come, or Don't Come bets.
